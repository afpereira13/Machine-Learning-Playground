# Machine-Learning-Playground
This a simple Machine-Learning Playground.
The goal is to predict te peak_position of a song.

The technical goals are:
- Read a .csv (dataframe);
- Understand how peak_position correlates with other columns
- Transform:
  - Preprocess date
  - Clean undesired columns;
  - Remove NaN rows;
- Present accuracy scores for different training models, using different classifiers

## Dataset
The dataset "billboard.csv" is an example of a Billboard TOP 100 musics! The dataset has 10 columns.
This dataset can be downloaded in kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/top-100-billboard.

## Classifiers
Running the MLbasics.py file it is possible to retrieve the accuracy scores for the following classifiers:
- Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Neural Net
